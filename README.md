# Job Search Application
## Description
This app will be created using the MERN stack. The purpose of this app will be to provide the user a way to document the actions they have taken in their job search. As unemployment requires documentation of actions taken to ensure receiving continuing benefits, I have decided to make this app to help myself and anyone else dealing with lay offs at this time.

## How to Install and Run the Project
The end result will be a web hosted app. Until then you can clone the repository and set up a locally hosted version using the MERN stack.
